\section{The velocity profile}
The stability of the wake downstream of a thin, symmetric, half-submerged airfoil NACA 0003 is considered. Detailed velocity measurements at various downstream locations of the wake are given by Mattingly \& Criminale (1970) \cite{RN7}. A hyperbolic function is used to fit the measured velocity profiles,
\begin{equation}
    \displaystyle \frac{U -U_{\infty }}{U_{c} -U_{\infty }} =\frac{1}{\cosh^{2}( \sigma z/b)},
    \label{eq:U}
\end{equation}
where $b$ id the half-width of the wake, and $U_c$ is the center-line velocity. The constant $\sigma=0.88137$ is chosen so that $( U-U_{\infty }) /( U_{c} -U_{\infty }) =0.5$ at $z=b$, as given in Dimas (1988) \cite{RN8}.

Local stability for near-wake is considered, and the velocity profile used throughout this thesis is the velocity profile fitted at a location downstream of the airfoil $x/L=0.003$, where $L$ is the chord length of the airfoil. The corresponding center-line velocity is $U_c/U_{\infty}=0.0012$.
